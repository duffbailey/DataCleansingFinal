Human Activity Smartphone Data Summary
version 1.0
==================================================================
This project provides a script that summarizes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0 created by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz,  Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. of:
	Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
	DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
	Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
	activityrecognition@smartlab.ws
	www.smartlab.ws
==================================================================
The project contains the following files:
run_analysis.R
body_movement_observation_sample.csv
body_movement_observation_means.csv
README.txt
run_analysis_codebook.doc
run_analysis_codebook.pdf

==================================================================
run_analysis.R
*** Over View
Sets up the environment, reads in data from their observation data set, extracts standard deviations and means, and combine the test and training subject data and produces the two csv files.  

It uses the following files from getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip which can be downloaded from:
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
and assumes that the sub folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and its constituents has been copied into the project folder.

For more information about the source datasets contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws or refer to the README.txt file contained in the project zip file.

==================================================================
body_movement_observation_sample.csv
Contains just the mean and std deviation for each observation interval in the x_test and x_train files.  Observations are tagged with the subject id, the numeric activity code and the activity description (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).  Columns are labled with the descriptive labels found in features.txt.

==================================================================
body_movement_observation_means.csv
Provides the mean of each value for each activity and subject found in body_movement_observation_sample.csv

MS word version of the codebook (for editing) 
==================================================================
run_analysis_codebook.pdf
pdf version of the codebook for distribution.  lists data fields found in each output file along with their sources and transformations.
